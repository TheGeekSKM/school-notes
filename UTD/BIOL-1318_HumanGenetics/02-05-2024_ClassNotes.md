# Chapter 4: Single Gene Inheritance

### Notes
- we used to thing that all diseases were caused by a single gene
  - this has now been proved to be untrue

## Characteristic of a Single Gene Disease
- diseases are caused by single genes
- if there are affected members in the family, we try to assess who else in the same family show symptoms of a similar disease
  - is the disease random in the family or has it been passed down
- tests to determine presence of these symptomg
- some of the diseases are more common in certain populations
- dominant, recessive mode of inheritance

## Following Gene Inheritance
- **mode** of inheritance -> how a gene is inherited
  - autosomal dominant -> all the chromosomes that are not sex chromosomes cause this disease
    - only has to appear once
    - appears in every genration
  - autosomal recessive -> all the chromosomes that are not sex chromosomes cause this disease
    - needs to appear on both chromosomes
    - can skip generation through carriers
  - x linked diseases -> females and males
  - y linked diseases -> only males
- **homozygous** -> same gene/allele present in both homologous chromsomes
- **heterozygous** -> different gene/alleles present in both homologous chromosomes
- **dominant** -> only need to be on one gene/allele
- **recessive** -> needs to be homozygous recessive to express itself.

## Gregor Mendel
- father of genetics
- trying to be a school teacher
- kept failing the tests he needed to take to be a teacher
- poor family
- he joined the monastery to get govt. funding for his education and research
- most of his experiments from 1857-1863
- experiminted on 24,034 plants
- created laws of inheritance that explain trait transmission in any diploid species
- became father of genetics posthumously

## Mendel's Experiments
- True-Breeding:
  - offspring have the same traits as parents
    - EX: short parents = short offspring
  - **Monohybrid Cross**: only observing one characteristic
    - EX: short plants vs tall plants
  - Created Hybrid crops

## Monohybrid Cross
1. P1 = Tall x Short
2. F1 = No Short Plants -> Non True Breeding since there are no short plants and that parental characteristic is gone
3. Self-Cross = Crossbred F1 with other F1 plants
4. F2 = 1/4th Short, 3/4th Tall -> 3:1 ratio

- Elementan -> something that denotes a characteristic (called gene nowadays)
- Some Elementan masked other Elementan (called dominant and recessive)
- Law of Segregation -> "elementen" separate during breeding in the gametes in order to create opportunity for randomness in gene selection


## Mendel's Law of Segregation
- homozygous -> TT or tt (Mendel called it True Breeding)
- heterozygous -> Tt (Mendel called it Non-True Breeding)
- genotype -> what you have inside your cells as alleles, cannot be seen outwardly
- phenotype -> observable traits expressed from genotype
  - Wild Type -> most common phenotype whether thats recessive or dominant
  - Mutant Phenotype -> variant of a gene's expression that arises when the gene undergoes mutation
    - different from the Wild Type
- Mendel observed that variations only happened when he crossbred plants
  - elementen needed to be shuffled during the process of reproduction
- Law of Segregation can be partially explained with the Law of Segregation
- 3:1 ratio of Dominant:Recessive was consistently present in F2
- Recessive Characteristic was mostly masked in F1

## Punnett Squares
- statician named Punnett and made a more statistical and mathematical approach to Mendel's Studies
- if you know the genotype of the parents, you should be able to tell the genotype and phenotype of the offspring

## Test Cross
- a Cross where a Homozygous Recessive is used
- **Mendel distinguished the TT from the Tt with the test cross**
- Recap:*Monohybrid Cross -> 3:1 (1 TT, 2 Tt, 1 tt)*
- mix a tall plant (TT or Tt) with a short plant (tt)
  - if it is homozygous dominant the offspring would be all tall (the same outcome as the monohybrid cross)
  - if it is heterozygous dominant the offspring would yield 1/2 heterozygous dominant and 1/2 recessive

## Notes:
1. Single Gene Diseases are rare
2. Phenotypes associated with Single Genes are also influenced by other genes and the environment

## Eye Color and Skin Color
- difference in melanin amount
  - melanin protects the body against DNA damage
- OCA2 gene -> melanin secretion
  - absence of OCA2 in a homozygote condition = albinism
  - OCA2 in recessive homozygote condition = lighter eye color
  - OCA2 in dominant homozygous or heterozygous condition = darker eye color
- HERC2
  - sits on top of OCA2 and controls function of OCA2
  - if absent (recessive homozygous), the eye color becomes lighter regardless of OCA2 presence


## Modes of Inheritance Part 2
- Autosome Pattern and Sex Chromosome Pattern is different
- Autosomal Dominant
  - both males and females
  - every generation shows the disease
  - parents usually have the same disease
  - Aa (Carrier:Expresses) + aa (Homozygous:No Expression) -> (2 x Aa) + (2 x aa) -> 2 expressions 
- Autosomal Recessive
  - both male and females
  - skips generation
  - can skip parent but still be carriers -> Autosomal Recessive's Parents who don't have the disease are Heterozygotes
  - Aa(Carrier:No Expression) + Aa(Carrier:No Expression) -> (AA) + (2 x Aa) + (aa) -> 1 expression
  - usually seen in consanguinous marriages

## Consanguinous Marriage
- interfamily marriages
- monarchial families
- DO NOT DO THIS
- disease remains in same family

## Solving Genetic Problems
1. List all the genotypes and phenotypes for the trait
2. Determine the genotypes of the parents
3. Form the Punnett Square
4. Determine the genotype of the F1 generation
