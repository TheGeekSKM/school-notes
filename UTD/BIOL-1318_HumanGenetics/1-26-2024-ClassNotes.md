## Cells
- structural and functional units of any living organism
- cellular bodies define us and perform the different functions of our body
- disorders in cells can cause diseases
- cellular functions depend on the genetics and chromosomes inside
- over 290 specialized cells
  - specialized cells have subtypes, and even cells that look alike may differe in their patterns of gene expression

### Four Basic Tissue Types
  - **Epithelial**
    - protective shielding tissue
    - skin
    - hold and protect the organ/organism together
    - forms glands in your body -> sweat, oil, etc.
  - **Connective**
    - packages organs and fills spaces in body
    - most complex and most amount of variety
    - forms blood -> lymph
    - cartilage, fat, and bone
  - **Muscle**
    - cells contract and expand, providing movement
  - **Nervous**
    - neurons transmit information as electrochemical pulses that coordinate movement and alos sense and respond to external stimuli
    - neurogelia supports and nourish neurons
    - mostly in the brain

### Diploid vs Haploid
- somatic cells have two copies of the genome and are said to be **diploid cells**
- sperm and egg cells have one copy of the genome and are **haploid cells**
- **stem cells** can divide to give to rise to differentiated cells and replicate themselves through self-renewal

## Cell Chemical Constituents
- the major macromolecules are:
  - **Carbohydrates**
    - provide energy and contribute to cell structure
  - **Lipids**
    - form the basis of some hormones, from membranes, provide insulation, and store energy
  - **Proteins**
    - most of the structure is made up of proteins
    - proteins also make up the skeletal system that keeps the body upright
    - **Enzymes**
      - help in speeding up metabolic reactions
      - catalyzers for reactions
  - **Nucleic Acids** (DNA and RNA)

## A Generalized Animal Cell
- Surrounded by **plasma membrane**
- Contains intracellular **organelles**
- Contains:
  - **Cytoplasm**
  - Stored Proteins, Carbs, and Lipids
  - Pigment Molecules
  - Nucleus
    - Nuclear Membrane
  - Endoplasmic Reticuli
  - Mitochondria -> produces ATP
  - Golgi Apparati

## Organelles
- Division of labor inside the cell
  - partitioning certain areas or serving specific functions
- Keep related biochemicals and structures close to one another to interact efficiently
- Functions:
  - respond to the genes and know what functions to perform
  - aquire energy

## Nucleus
- promiment organelle
- surrounded by a layer of nuclear envelope
- Contains:
  - nuclear pores that allow movement of biochemicals
    - guarding proteins that decide whether to keep the pore closed or open it up
  - **Nucleolus** sits inside Nucleus and helps make ribosomes

## Endoplamic Reticulum
- Rough ER -> has ribosomes on it
  - this is where translation happens between RNA to proteins
- Smooth ER -> has no ribosomes
  - this is for lipid synthesis
- sits right next to nucleus
- proteins exiting the ER are in small sacs called Vesicles
- proteins cannot fully function

## Golgi Apparatus
- fewer in number
- still sac-like
- finish the structure of protein and make it functional
- will add certain chemical groups to it to make the protein functional
- these proteins will be sent to the plasmic membrane to usually be released into the world

## Lysosomes
- get rid of anything that isn't useful to the cell
- constantly monitors the cell to get rid of excess and unneccesary stuff
- too much useless stuff is caused by Lysosomal Diseases where the Lysosome functions properly
- Lysosomes help the cell destroy itself if the cell has too much useless material.

## Peroxisomes
- make bile acids
- lipids
- detoxification
- Free Radicals are destroyed by this.
  - chemicals which are destructive to the body
- Liver/Kidney


## Mitochondria
- powerhouse of the cell
- membrane on the outside
- folded membane on the inside: Cristae
- breaks down food into **adenosine triphosphate (ATP)**

## Biological Membrane
- plant cells have cell walls, but animal cells only have plasmic membrane
  - our cell wall is delicate
- made up of **phospholipids**
- head of phospholipid is outside and inside
- tails of phospholipid always faces inwards because it is hydrophobic
- has proteins that act as channels that act as bouncers.

## Cytoskeleton
- meshwork of protein rods and tubes
- maintains the shape of the cell
- three major types of proteins
  - **Microtubules**
  - **Microfilaments**
  - **Intermediate Filaments**


## Cell Division and Cell Death
- Mitosis
  - division of DNA and rest of the cell
  - basically duplication of cell
  - how cells reproduce
- Cytokinesis
  - division of a cell into two distinct cells
- Apoptosis
  - cell death
  - precise, genetically programming sequence of events


## Cell Cycles
- mostly spending in nondividing state -> mostly lazy
- Somatic Cells divide in three stages
  - DNA replication
    - duplicates genetic material exactly
  - Mitosis
    - divides genetic material equally
  - Cytokinesis
    - divdes cytoplasm and organelles into two daughter cells

## Interphase
1. **G-zero** -> specialized cell functions only
2. **G-one** -> cell growth, organelle duplication, protein synthesis
3. **S** -> DNA replication and histone synthesis
4. **G-two** -> finishes protein synthesis and centriole replication

## Mitosis
- Prophase
  - chromasomes tightly coiled
  - still see nuclear envelope
- Metaphase
  - chromasomes appear right at the cnter of the Nucleus
  - centrioles will extend spindle fibers which attach to the chromosomes and split them
  - chromosmes are pulled with equal force
- Anaphase
  - spindle fibers pull
  - chromatids separate and become independent chromasomes
    - move to opposite ends of cell
- Telophase
  - spinde falls appart and nucleus duplicates
- Cytokinesis
  - where the actual cells splits into two daughter cells

## Cell Cycle Control
- proteins act as checkpoint controls
- if the cells has not completed the previous step, then the cell will stall and it will then move forwards
- in cancer cells, these checkpoints will fail to work, so these cells will continue to duplicate uncontrollably

## Telomeres
- located at ends of chromosomes
- repeat of thymine and adenine
- everytime the cell divides, the cell gets shorter
  - the **Telomere** acts as a buffer
- You lose 50-100 end-most bases after each cell division
- after 50 divisions, shortened telomeres signal the cell to stop dividing -> death
- sperm, eggs, bone marrow, and cancer cells can protect telomeres to continue dividing

## Stem Cells
- stem cells mitosify into progenetor cells which cannot make more progenetor cell
  - once they differentiate, they cannot go back
- **Totipotent** -> can form any and every cell type in your body
- **Pluripotent** -> have fewer possible fates, have already undergone some type of differentiation
- **Multipotent** -> have only a few developmental choices
