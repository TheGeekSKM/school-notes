# Beyond Mendel's Laws
- a lot of Mendel's theories do not always hold true -> he was only working with simple pea plants
  

### Exceptions to Mendel's Laws:
- Mendel's traits showed only two distinct form
- Most genes are not as simple as to only have two variants
- Genotypic ratios will persist no matter what, but phenotypic ratios can be varied due to influences from outside the gene:
  - Multiple alleles
  - Other Nuclear Genes
    - mitochondria has its own genome and its own dna
  - Non Nuclear Genes
  - Gene Linkage
  - Environment

### First Example: Lethal Alleles
- can cause death before birth before the individual can reproduce
- these alleles can never be seen in the population
  - ex: Achondroplatic Dwarfism
    - in this example, the homozygous recessive is the wild type
    - heterozygote carries of the mutant allele have dwarfism
    - AA are dead 
    - aa are everyone else

### Second Example: Multiple Alleles
- Normally, individual carries two alleles for each autosomal gene
- But, gene can have multiple alleles because its sequence can deviate in many ways
- ex: Eye Color
  - Brown, Blue, Hazel, etc
- In a population most alleles will not have two options, but there will instead by many variations of alleles.
- ex: Cystic Fibrosis can have 1500 alleles that might have mutated

### Third Example: Incomplete Dominance
- two alleles, neither is dominant and neither is recessive
- ex: high cholestrol
  - familial hypercholestrolemia
  - heterozygote has 1/2 the normal number of receptors in the liver for cholesterol
  - homozygote for the mutant allele totally lacks the receptor or they can have the receptor
- How to identify:
  - Heterozygote does not express the dominant trait, but instead expresses 1/2 of the dominant trait

### Fourth Example: Codominance
- two alleles will have the same phenotype
- ex: blood grouping
  - your blood grouping is dependent on what proteins are on your red blood cells
  - Ia + Ia or Ia + i -> Type A
  - Ib + Ib or Ib + i -> Type B
  - In both cases, Ia and Ib are both dominant and both work in similar ways and affect the blood stream simularly
    - similar to Multiple Alleles
  - IaIa x IbIb -> AB AB AB AB
- between Ia and Ib there is no dominant


## Definition:
1. Penetrance: bool value for expressed or non expressed
2. Expressivity: float value for how much or how well the gene is expressing

### Fifth Example: Pleiotropy
- one gene is responsible for many characteristics in the body
- ex: Porphyria Variegate
  - varied illnesses and quirks appeared to be different unrelated disorders

### Sixth Example: Genetic Heterogeneity
- different genes can produce identical phenotyeps
- different genes influence one phenotype
  - ex: hearing loss -> 132 autosomal recessive forms
  - ex: osteogenesis imperfecta -> at least two genes involved
  - ex: alzheimer's disease -> at least four different genes involved
  

### Seventh Example: Phenocopy
- environmental reason for gene expression
- terratogens
- carcinogen
- AIDs virus can be passed from mother to child and it can look like it was inherited but it wasn't


## Mitochondrion
- it has its own dna(mtDNA) and genes
- it has 37 genes
- ALL genes make proteins
- No crossing over and little DNA repair
- High exposure to free radicals -> don't eat unhealthy
- Mutation rate is greater than nuclear DNA
- Cells will not detect issues within the mitochondrial dna due to mutations
- Mitochondria DNA comes from **mother** to child
- *Mitochondrial DNA is circular and there are several copies*

### Eighth Example: Linkage
- lack of independent assortment
- Genes are interconnected and move from parent to child together
- Does not produce typical Mendelian ratios
- crossing over is a way to get rid of linkage but still

## Definition Part 2
1. Parental Chromosomes -> no change in alleles, alleles are so close that it keeps them together
2. Recombinant Chromosomes -> change in alleles. Alleles are far apart enough so that they were able to cross over
- scientists use this to make **linkage maps**
  - the amount of recombination is dependent on how far the genes are from each other.

### Allele Configuration
- Cis -> two dominant or two recessive alleles are on each chromosomes
- Trans -> One dominant and one recessive are present on each chromosome

### Linkage Disequilibrium
- when the genes are so close, they do not get sorted indepently
- those genes are said to be in **Linkage Disequilibrium Blocks**


### Haplotype
- mapping of LD blocks across the chromosome
- Set of sequences that are inherited from one generation to another because they are linked together
- Makes it possible to track certain chromosome segments in pedigrees
