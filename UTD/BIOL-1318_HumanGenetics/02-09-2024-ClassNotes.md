## Monohybrid Cross
- Mono = One
- Mendel's First Law of Segregation will always refer to this

## Test Cross
- determines genotype of other parent plant
- will always involve homozygous recessive organism

## On the Meaning of Dominant and Recessive
- Dominant: AA or Aa
  - dominant charactistic -> homozygous or heterozygous
- Recessive: aa
  - recessive characteristic -> only homozygous
- Recessive traits are usually due to "loss of function"
  - DNA a lost the ability to generate proteins
  - DNA a also lost the ability to generate proteins
  - Allele aa now has lost the ability to generate proteins
  - both DNA strands in an allele must have the mutation in order to lose the ability to perform an action (homozygous)
- Dominant traits are usually due to "gain of function"
  - DNA A has gained the ability to create a toxic protein
  - DNA a still doesn't have the ability to make the toxic protein
  - Allele Aa still makes toxic protein, albeit 50% of the amount of toxic proteins that it could make (heterozygous)

## Mendel's Second Law of Independent Assortment
- Mendel was lucky
  - all the characteristic Mendel studied, all of those characteristics were independent chromosomes
- __*The inheritance of one gene or allele does not affect the inheritance of another*__
  - this can **only** happen if genes are independent
- If alleles are dependent, then there would be **significantly less mutation** since the genes would carry each other to their offspring
- RR YY rr yy
  - -> [RY RY ry ry] or [Ry Ry rY rY]
  - the combo of Rs and Ys are completely independent of each other **R** could have **Y** or **y** and **r** could have **Y** or **y**

## Dihybrid Cross
- P1: Round Yellow Seed vs Wrinkled Green Seed
- F1: All Round Yellow Seeds -> Yellow and Round must be Dominant
  - Yellow Round Offspring = 4 x RrYy
- F2: Self Cross -> RrYy x RrYy -> **this is the main dihybrid cross**
  - RY rY Ry ry x RY rY Ry ry
    - RRYY, RRYy, RrYY, RrYy
    - RRYy, RRyy, RrYy, Rryy
    - RrYY, RrYy, rrYY, rrYy
    - RrYy, Rryy, rrYy, rryy
  - ***Phenotypical Ratio -> 9 (Round and Yellow) : 3 (Round and green) : 3 (wrinkled and Yellow) : 1 (wrinkled and green)***


## Probability
- Product Rule:
  - how can two traits which are homozygous be present together in an offspring
  - how can two independent events (rr and yy) appear in a gamete
- Example: what is the probability of obtaining (rryy) plants from dihybrid parents (RrYy)


## Product Rules
- 2 separate Punnett Square
- RrYy x RrYy
  - Rr x Rr = RR Rr Rr rr -> P(rr) = 1/4
  - Yy x Yy = YY Yy Yy yy -> P(yy) = 1/4
  - 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 = P(rryy)

## Pedigree Analysis
- give us understanding of almost all the stuff that we just studied
- A Family Tree analysis that depicts the transmission of inherited traits

- if Black Tiles skip generations -> Dominant
- Random spread of Black Male and Female Tiles -> Autosomal
- Person who is being tested is either FULLY WHITE or FULLY BLACK -> they can be either heterozygous or homozygous, but they will be given the benefit of the doubt
