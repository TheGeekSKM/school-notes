## Spermatogenesis
- a diploid **spermatogonium** divides by mitosis to produce a stem cell and another cell that specializes into a mature sperm.
  - like a regular cell
  - meiosis has not yet ocurred
- **Meiosis I** -> the daughter cells produced are called **secondary spermatocytes**
  - Already haploid
- **Meiosis II** -> each secondary spermatocyte produce two equal **spermatids**
  - spermatids mature into tadpole-like creatures called **spermatozoa**
- Every 7-14 days, new sperm cells are produced

### Sperm
1. Head:
   1. Acrosome -> chemicals that go close to the egg and start dissolving the protective cell around the egg
      1. Acrosomal Mutation will not allow fertilization
2. Midpiece:
   1. Spiral Mitochondria -> produces energy for sperm to move
      1. Mitochondrial Mutation makes sperm move slower

### Paternal Age Effect
- sperm can be produced till a man is around 50
- *Paternal Age Effect* conditions arise from stem cells in the testis that divide every 16 days offering many opportunities for DNA mutations
- Mutations in the Fibroglast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) can result in babies born with skeletal defects

## Oogenesis
- diploid -> **oogonium**
- Meiosis I -> (onset of puberty) oogonium divides **unequally**
  - **secondary oocyte** (50% of the chromosomes) + **polar body** (50% of the chromosomes, but relatively useless)
  - the polar body is just there to split chromosomes and literally does nothing else and gets disintigrates
- Meiosis II -> secondary oocyte divides to create a **mature ovum** and another **polar body**
- *Generally, less eggs in female than sperm in males*
  - it is vital for the egg to be perfect, so the body would rather spend more energy into making one "perfect" egg rather than a million deformed eggs
- Oogenesis is a discontinuous process
  - Meiosis I starts at time of birth
  - Oocytes stay in Prophase I until puberty
    - after puberty, meiosis I continues but halts again in metaphase II
  - Meiosis is only completed if the ovum is fertilized
- *Eggs released during menstruation were never really mature eggs!*

## Prenatal Human
- considered an **embryo** for the first 8 weeks
  - high risk of miscarriage
  - embryo is still trying to check if it's capable of life
- from the start of the 9 weeks until birth it is a **fetus**

## Fertilization
- coming together of a sperm and an oocyte
- sperm are capicated -> attracted towards the oocyte, but sperm and egg releases these hormones
- when sperm reaches the egg, the acrosome releases enzymes that melt the protective shell of the egg
- when sperm enters, the egg will try to prevent any other sperm from entering
- sperm and oocyte -> **zygote**
- after fertilization Meiosis II will continue after metaphase II

## Cleavage
- the period of frequent mitotic divisions
  - early cells produced are called **blastomeres**
- When zygote has >16 cells, it's called a **morula**
  - hole forms in morula called [**blastocyst**](#blastocyst)

## Blastocyst
- inner cell mass develops in embryo
- trophoblast secrets **human chrorionic gonadrotropin** that prevents menstruation
  - trophoblast develops around the embryo
  - HCG can be used to test for pregnancy
- Implantation in the uterus occurs in the 7th day

## Embryo Formation
- 2 weeks late
- embryo has layers
  - outer layer -> **ectoderm:** what makes skin, nails, glands, nervous tissue
  - middle layer -> **mesoderm:** muscles, lymphatic muscles
  - inner layer -> **endoderm:** most important organs made by this
- 3 layers of embryo called **gastrula**

## Supportive Structures
- structures that support embryo
- by 10 weeks, placenta is fully formed and remains till the end of the pregnancy

## Multiple Births
- Dizygotic Twins (Fraternal)
  - look different
  - two sperm fertilize two oocytes
  - same genetic relationship as any two siblings
- Monozygotic Twins (Identical)
  - arise from single fertilized ovum
    - one egg divides into two
  - three types of MZ twins can form
    - competition between twins can kill one or the other

## Organogenesis
- transformation of the 3 simple layers into distinct organs
- week 3 - week 8
- very crucial for pregnancy

## The Fetus Grows
- starts with cartilage and eventually gets replaced with bone
- nerve and muscle functions become coordinated
- 1st trimester -> sex organs become more distinct
- week 12 -> sucking of fingers, etc
- very critical -> this is when birth defects can happen
  - no cigarettes, alcohol, or chemicals

## Teratogens
- chemicals or other agents that cause birth defects
- cause of birt hdefects due to exposure to a drug depend upon a woman's genes
- examples:
  - thalidomide -> use to be common in medicine and caused appendage damage and is **STILL PRESENT IN MEDICINES!!**
  - cigarettes
  - alcohol
  - TAKE VITAMINS PLEASE
  - occupational hazards -> second hand smoking
  - viral infections

## Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
- mental retardation
- small head circumference
- low nasal bridge
- eye folds
- short nose 
- thin upperlip

## Birth Defects due to Viruses
- small enough to cross placenta and reach fetus
- some viruses that cause mild symptoms in an adult can deviscerate the fetus
- Zika virus causled Microcephaly and makes head and brain smaller

## Longevity
- aging reflects genetic activity and a lifetime of environmental influences
- families and geneticaly isolated populations with many aged members have
  - gene variants
  - shared environmental influences
- *genome comparisons among average genes have revealed that there are genes that can aleveate diseases that cause death*
