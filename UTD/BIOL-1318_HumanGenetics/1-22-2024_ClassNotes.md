# Chapter 1 Contd.

## Recap
- Genes make proteins
- Genes can be mutated to produce mutated proteins and cause diseases


## Genome
- is the total collection of genes in any organism -> specifically for a species
  - took many years to understand the human genome
- genomics -> field of study for genes
  - structure, function, what happens if genes mutate, what makes us different from each other.

## Bioethics
- we need to clearly define the privacy and restructions of important human data in the form of genes and gene research


## Deoxyribonucleic Acid
- Components:
  - Two Arms or Two Strands of DNA
    - they wind up around each other and remain connected to each other by the "rungs" of the ladder
  - "Rung" of ladder is called a **Nuceotide** and it is connected with  **Hydrogen Bonds**
    - Hydrogen bonds are the weakest bonds, but so many Hydrogen Bonds keeps it secure
    - This makes DNA one of the most stable molecule on Earth
    - You can find DNA of creatures that have been extinct for billions of years
- **Adenine**, **Thymine**, **Cytosine**, and **Guanine** -> Bases
- 1x Base + 1x Sugar + 1x Phosphate Group = 1x Nucleotide 
- DNA builds proteins through **Amino Acid Production**

## Ribonucleic Acid
- DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes the protein
- Single stranded unlike the DNA which is double stranded
- One of the most unstable molecules known in evolution
- Also made up of bases
  - Thymine => Urasil
  - A, U, G, C instead of A, T, G, C

## Central Dogma (Central Established Theory)
- DNA -> RNA -> Proteins
- DNA -> RNA:
  - known as **Transcription**
- RNA -> Protein:
  - known as **Translation**
- Proteins
  - made up of Amino Acids
  - anytime there is a problem in the DNA, that gets Transribed into an RNA, which gets Translated into a protein
  - mistakes only and always happen in the DNA, not the RNA or the Protein
- We once thought that every gene in a DNA makes one protein, but this was proven false
  - **One Gene-One Polypeptide Hypotheosis**

## Cystic Fibrosis
- genetic discorder
- issue with mucus flowing in the body
- mutation that took place in a gene in Chromosome 7
  - a mutation is simply a change in a Base
  - the CFTR protein-which acts as a clog for mucus-does not open and does not allow mucus to pass through it
  - the mutated protein just sits like a block leading to many many symptoms

## Human Genome
- only 1.5% of our Genome is actually "useful" or makes proteins
  - the group that actually makes proteins is called the **exome**
- What does the rest do?
  - could act like buffers so that if any of the 98.5% gets mutated, nothing happens to them
- Genes known to cause discorders or traits are cataloged in a database called **OMIM**

## Gene Variants
- **alleles** are variants of genes
  - the same gene that makes the black hair color, also makes other hair colors
  - these are known as alleles
  - the first human race only had black hair
  - overtime, that hair color gene underwent mutations and now we have ranges
  - same with skin color
- "Phenotype" -> means changes we can see
- Mutations in sperm or egg cells are passed on to the next generation
  - hereditary cancer and non-hereditary cancer
- Mutations can be positive, negative, or neutral
  - Randomness


## Trait
- a trait is a characteristic
- **Mendelian Traits** are caused by a single gene
  - more than five fingers
- **Multifactorial Traits** are determined by one or more genes and environmental factors
  - most diseases we study are Multifactorial Traits
    - skin color and hair color


## Cells
- human body contains ~37,000,000,000,000 cells
  - each cell shares the same genome EXCEPT FOR RED BLOOD CELLS
- different cells have different part of the genome activated
- *different programmers will be working based off of different sections of the same Game Design Document*
- Stem Cells are like reserve cells
  - less specialized and provide a reserve supply of cells


## More Terms:
- **Genotype:** refers to the alleles present and genes present
  - some alleles will mask other alleles -> Dominant and Recessive
- **Phenotype:** traits that I can see
  - you might have the traits for red hair, but I only see black hair
- **Dominant:** allele is expressed even if the individual carries only one copy of the allele
- **Recessive:** allele must be present on both chromosomes of pair to be expressed


## Families
- individuals are genetically connected into families
- Charts called Pedigrees will depic the members of the family in terms of their genes
  - indicates which individuals had a particular set of inherited traits

## Population
- group of individuals that can reproduce
- **gene pool:** collection of genes in this population

## Evolution
- evolution of species and family patterns of traits show divergence from shared ancestors
- humans are 98% similar to chimpanzees and gorillas
- we all came from a common ancestor and mutated into different species

## Applications of Genetics
- DNA profiling compares DNA sequences among individuals to establish or rule out identity, relationships, or ancestry
- what can go wrong and how can we fix it?
- we can artifically reproduce near extinct species
  - conservation genomics
- Genetic Forensics
  - identification of victims of natural disasters or terrorist attacks
  - matching DNA of suspects to samples
  - helping adopted individuals locate blood relatives
- Can provide information of pathogens and past epidemics

## Cancer
1. Prognostic -> likeliness to develop cancer
2. Diagnostic -> what kind of cancer is it
3. Predictive -> is this the optimal drug for my cancer
4. Pharmacodynamics -> what is the optimal dose for my body
5. Recurrence -> will the cancer return?
- personalized medicine instead of generic medicine for disease
