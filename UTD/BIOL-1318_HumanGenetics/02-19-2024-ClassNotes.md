# Chapter 6 -> Matters of Sex


### Our Sexual Selves
- **Layer #1:** male of female is determined at conception (when sperm meets egg)
  - XX female XY male
- Development of Hormones will be dependent on the XX or XY chromosomes
  - based on this, the reproductive structures will develop
- Biological Factors and Social Cues influence sexual feelings


### Fifth Week
- embryo inside uterus
- all embryos develop a set of **unspecialized or indifferent** gonads
  - gonads cannot be told apart from each other
- **Mullerian (female)** and **Wolffian (male)** ducts
- based on the chromosomes, some genes will express themseles
- ***SRY Gene** is present only on the Y Chromosome*


## Sex Chromosome Determines Gender
- males are hetero-gametic sex (XY)
  - males can make X-Bearing Sperms or Y-Bearing Sperms
- females are homogametic sex (XX)
  - females can only make X-Bearing Eggs
- Snakes are different
  - snake males are homogametic

## What Happens to the Gonads During the Fifth Week
1. Undifferentiated Bodies (gonads)
   1. Every Embryo has 2 sets of tubes **Wollfian Duct (blue on the inside)** and the **Mullerian Duct (red on outside)**
2. SRY Gene on Y Chromosome
   1. SRY is a transcription factor (Making RNA from DNA, capable of switching on other genes)
   2. If SRY is PRESENT -> gonads become testes, Mullerian Duct will vanish
   3. If SRY is ABSENT -> gonads become ovaries, Wollfian Duct will vanish

## 4th or 5th Month
- gonads distinguishable


## X or Y Chromosome
- X Chromosome is larger than Y Chromosomes
- X Chromosomes:
  - More than 1500 Genes
  - Acts as Homolog (Pair) to Y in males
- Y Chromosome:
  - Contains 231 genes
  - Many DNA segments are repeated palindromes (same backwards and forward) and may destabilize DNA replication
  - ex:
    - GAATTC
    - CTTAAG
  - This is difficult for DNA Polymerase and RNA Polymerase -> this is the hotspot for mutation
    - when the Polymerases stuttur, they bring in new aspects
  - Y chromosome mutations are very common


## Anatomy of Y Chromosome
- ends are called PsuedoAutosomal Regions (PAR-1 and PAR-2)
  - these are the regions that have similar genes to the X chromosome
  - rest of the entire chromosome is male specific genes
- Everyting that is not the PAR is MSY (male specific region)
  - contains SRY and AZF (needed for sperm production)


## SRY Chromosome
  - **transcription factor**
    - creates proteins that aid in the creation of other RNA
    - influences creation of testosteron and DHT (dihydrotestosteron)



## Abnormalities in Sexual Development
- Androgen Insensitivity Hormone:
  - Androgen made by SRY
  - Androgen has to bind to receptors in testes
  - Androgen might not have places to bind in the testes
  - Androgen makes spermatogonia
  - Male cannot make spermatogonia
- Pseudohermaphoditism:
  - presence of male and female structure at different stages of life
  - mostly seen in males
    - have female reproductive structure and male reproductive structure
    - neither are usually functional
    - Mullerian Ducts do not get completely disintegrated
  - 5-Alpha Reductase Deficiency = Complete Abscence of DHT
    - partial development of reproductive structures
  - Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia = High Level of Androgens
    - babies will reach puberty by 5 or 6


## Homosexuality
- documented in 500 animal species
- it has been seen in cultures for thousands of years
- attraction for one gender within the same gender
- based in physiology of body and social cues from the outside
  - no one chromsome
  - interaction of society with hormonal structure
- Ex of Genes + Environment:
  - Identical Twins are more likely to be homosexual than members of fraternal twins

## Sexual Identity
1. Conception -> gender identified in body
2. Gonadal Sex -> gonads develop around 6 weeks
3. Phenotypic Sex -> 8 weeks after fertilization
4. Gender Identity -> from childhood, possibly after
5. Sexual Orientation -> from childhood, puberty


# Sexual Identity is comprised of both the genome of a person, and their environment


## Sex Ratios
- Proportion of males to females in a human population
  - calculated by (#ofMales / #ofFemales) x 1000

1. Primary Sex Ratio -> at conception, only attainable in certain countries, parents are not often told the gender of the child before the birth of the child. This is because there is a history of females being terminated before the birth.
2. Secondary Sex Ratio -> at birth, available across the entire world. In some populations, females can be more than males, but usually males are more prominant
3. Tertiary Sex Ratio -> at maturity, census, etc


## Y Linked Traits
- carried by Y Chromosome
- Inheritance Pattern -> Male to Male
- Y Linked Traits are rare
- Most Y Linked Traits are related to infertility
- Natural Selection usually takes care of this since they cannot pass on Y Linked Mutation to offspring

## X Linked Traits
- Females -> X linked traits are passed like autosomal traits (50-50%)
- Males -> a single copy of an X linked allele causes expression of the trait or illness (tilted in direction of having disease)
- Males are considered **hemizygous**

Sex Determination in Humans
- 50-50% chance of male vs female

## X Linked Recessive
- always expressed in male
- can be masked in female
  - can only be present in female if the female is heterozygote
- Ex:
  - Ichthyosis -> skin is not as soft and breaks up
  - Colorblindness
  - Hemophilia -> disorder for blood-clotting, considered King's Disorder

## X Linked Dominant
- always expressed
- Ex:
  - Incontinentia Pigmenti
    - severe excema, inflamation, not an easy situation to live with
    - mother can pass defective gene or normal gene
      - son -> heterozygous: 50% chance, homozygous mom -> 100% chance
      - daughter -> 50% regardless of homozygous or heterozygous

# Essentially, BEAR in MIND that the Male will always only get the X from the Mother
- Sons will always inherit the X from the Mother
- Daughters might have a change of not expressing the allele since X can also come from father


## Sex Limited Traits
- seen in one particular gender
  - ex:
    - beard growth (male)
    - milk production (female)
    - preeclampsia: complications during childbirth (female)

## Sex Influenced Traits
- you'll see a lot of it in one gender, but there are examples in other genders
- ex:
  - baldness (dominant in males but can be possible in females)

## X Inactivation
- females are born with XX
- one X is inactivated
- happens very early on -> random
- alters the phenotype and not the genotype
- example of epigenetic change
- this change does **NOT** alter the DNA Sequence
- because of RNA SIST molecule that binds to chromosome and inactivates
  
**Note:** Within X Inactivation, dominant and recessive traits still continue to express, but apparently X Inactivation is not a complete process and it occurs on a spectrum.


## Genetic Imprinting
- some genes are blocked from expressing themselves
- this blockage happens chemically
- Methyl Group will stop genes from working
- The Parent with the Methyl Group is random
- sometimes good genes are masked
- sometimes bad genes are masked
- Epigenetic Change -> No Mutation, just layering it with something that adds the change
  - **Non-Destructive Workflow**
- Patterns vary from one generation to another
- **RANDOM**

## Gene Imprinting vs X Inactivation
Gene Imprinting -> Methyl Group
X Inactivation -> RNA Molecue
