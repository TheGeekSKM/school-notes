## Lecture Slides
- All available
- Use them to your wish


# Chapter 1: Overview
- What is Human Genetics
- Genetics
  - study of inherited traits and their variation
  - inheritance
  - difficult to define human characteristics might appear to be inherited from family, may share environmental influences
  - it can be considered at several levels, from DNA, to genes, to chromosomes, to individuals, to families and populations
  - **Genes + Environment = Me**

## Gene and Genetics
- Nucleus vs Chromosome vs Gene vs DNA
- **Body** = 1,000,000,000s of **cells**
  - Most cells are living
- Within cells, there is a **Nucleus**
- Within Nucleus, there are **chromosomes**
  - 23 pairs of chromosomes
  - all chromosomes occur in pairs
  - 46 total chromosomes
  - DO NOT FORGET THESE NUMBERS
  - different animals will have different number of pairs of numbers
  - sex is determined by birth, from chromosomes at birth
    - Sex Chromosomes
      - XY (males) and XX (female)
  - 22 Pairs = Autosomes, 1 Pair = Sex Chromosome
- **Chromosomes** are made of a double helix called **Deoxyribonucleic Acid or DNA**
  - DNA is tightly wound in a chromosomal X structure
  - You need an extremely high powered microscope to see the double helix
  - DNA is tightened with some proteins that keep the DNA tightly wound
- A Human Somatic Cell
  - Every cell that isn't an egg cell or a sperm cell
- **EGG and SPERM**
  - only have 23 total, and no pairs of chromosomes
  - 46 pairs of chromosomes would make the child far too powerful

## Genes
- inheritance
- units of heredity
- instructions that tell cells how to manufacture certain proteins
- Consists of of DNA
- Traits are produced by an interaction between genes and environment
  - genes are not standalone features all the time
- certain features **are** absolutely determined by your parents
  - but others can me altered or mitigated through lifestyle
- DNA is wound up around a protein called a **Histone**


## Total Picture
Cell > Nucleus > Chromosome > Genes > DNA wrapped around a Histone > Nucleotide

# The Genome
- all the genes in your body
- includes protein-encoding genes and other DNA sequences
- **Genomics** is a field that analyzes and compares genomes of a different species

## Bioethics
- addresses moral issues and controversies that arise in applying medical technology
- Bioethicists confront concerns that arise from new genetic technology
- **Never give out someone's Chromosomal Information without their consent**


## EXTRA INFO
- ***YOOO!! RED BLOOD CELLS DO NOT HAVE NUCLEUI AAAHHHHH***
  - Red Blood Cells cannot reproduce
- SOMATIC CELLS ARE NOT REPRODUCTIVE CELLS EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE CHROMOSOMES
