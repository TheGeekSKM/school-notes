# Meiosis, Development, and Aging
- the chromosome # is reduced to 1/2
- cell division is meiosis if the daughter cells have 23 chromosomes each
- very rare in the body
- meiosis is only in the sex cells
- everything else is **mitosis** instead of **meiosis**


## Human Development
- Genes orchesrate out physiology after conception through adulthood
- at the time of conception, gender is determined
  - sperm contains possible x or y chromosome and meets egg that only has x chromosome
  - **sperm determines gender**
  - different sperm carry different x or y chromosomes and different sperm cells determine what sex the offspring has.
- First cell forms when a **sperm** from a male and an **oocyte** from a female join
  - sperm and oocytes are **gametes**
- The genes of an offspring comes from the sperm (paternal characteristics) and oocyte (maternal characteristics) that come together that form an embryo
- **Meiosis** is the process of cell division that creates gametes and only gametes

## Human Development Part 2
- Each Reproductive System has:
  - Paired structures called **gonads**
    - testes vs ovaries
    - where the gametes are made
  - Tubular structures that transports these cells to where they need to go for fertilization
  - Hormones and secretions that control reproduction 

## Male Reproductive System
- simpler of the two systems
- less complex than the creation of egg
- all that the sperm contributes to the embryo is the chromosomes, the egg contributes literally everything else
  - maternal features/characteristics are more complicated and many complications in the development are maternal
- Sperm cells are made in the **seminiferous tubules** of the testes
  - the testes are filled with tubes where sperm is being produced
- Sperm cells are stored in the epididymis
- Sperm cells are carried through Ductus Deferens *(or VAS Deferens)*
  - this is where hormones are secreted and this is where semen is from
    - semen **is not the same as a** sperm
    - semen allows sperm to live for a long time
- Scrotal Sacs are formed inside the body originally, and during birth, they descend outside the body
  - when scrotal sacs do not descend out, this leads to infertility
- Males will continue to make sperm until quite late in the age unlike women who go through menopause where eggs will not be created

## Female Reproductive System
- Oocytes mature in the **ovaries**
- A newborn girl has 300,000 eggs
  - not all the eggs will reach maturity
  - only one egg per month will be released
- Once the egg is released, it will be in the uterus
  - this is where fertilization happens
- If the egg isn't fertilized, it is released in the uterus
  - at the same time, the uterus creates excess material to cushion the embryo
  - when the egg isn't fertilized, all the excess material gets released -> menstrual flow
- All of this is controlled by Hormones
  - if there is a hormonal imbalance, the whole cycle of menstruation can change
- Uterus rests on the urinary bladder
- Passage from Uterus to Outside -> Cervix
- Outside -> Vagina

## Meiosis
- Gametes are created by special cells called **germ line cells**
- Haploid -> one chromosome instead of pairs of chromosomes (23 instead of 46)
  - **homologous pair**: identical pairs have the same genes in the same order but carry different alleles
  - sperms and eggs **DO NOT** have homologous pairs
- Gametes are **haploid**
- Abscence of Meiosis could lead to genetically overloaded cells
  - tetraploid -> 2 copies from mom and 2 copies from dad
    - miscarriaged after about two days
- Meiosis mixes up trait combinations
  - two haploid cells mixing together essentially takes the possible parental characteristics and puts them in a blender.
- Meiosis provides genetic diversity which can enable a population to survive and environmental challenge
  - In Africa, there are some who suffer from sickle cell amenia -> blood disorder
    - sickle cell anemia cannot house plasmodium vivax which is a parasite rampant in mosquito bites
    - when individuals with sickle cell anema migrated, their traits spread and helped us thrive

## Meiosis Part 2
- Consists of two divisions
  - Meiosis I
    - The **reduction division**
    - reduces the # of chromosomes from 46 to 23
  - Meiosis II
    - the **equational division**
    - produce up to 4 cells from original 1 parent cell

## Differences between Meiosis and Mitosos
- **Mitosis** only has 1 division while **Meiosis** will always have 2 divisions
- **Mitosis** has two daughter cells from one cell, while **Meiosis** will always have 4 daughter cells
- **Mitosis** have genetically identical daughter cells, meiosis has some level of genetic diversity
- **Mitosis** happens in all somatic cells while **Meiosis** **only** happens in germ line cells 
- **Mitosis** occurss throughout lifetime, **Meiosis** occurs during sexual maturity
- **Mitosis** is for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction while **Meiosis** is only used for sexual reproduction
- **Mitosis** does not occur within gametes until they become fertilized (at which point, they no longer stay as gametes)

## Meiosis Phases
1. Prophase I
   1. homologs pair-up and undergo **crossing over**
   2. homologous pairs can exchange genes with each other during **crossing over**
2. Metaphase I
   1. random alignment of chromosomes causes **independent assortment**
3. Anaphase I
4. Telophase I
5. Prophase II
   1. nothing out of the ordinary of normal prophase and metaphase
6. Metaphase II
7. Anaphase II
   1. same as the original ordinary anaphase and metaphese
8. Telophase II
9.  4 non-identical haploid daughter cells
