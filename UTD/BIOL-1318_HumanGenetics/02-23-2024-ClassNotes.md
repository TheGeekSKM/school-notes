# Chapter 9 -> DNA

Francis Crick -> "A genetic material must carry out two jobs: 
    1. duplicate itself
    2. control the development of the rest of the cell in a specific way"

- RNA can't divide itself, but DNA can make decisions on when to divide

## History of DNA
- **Friedrich Miescher, 1871**
  - a lot of science at this point was done by doctors -> no real scientists
  - Swiss Physician and Biochemist
  - As he dressed war wounds, he saw pus
    - doctors had no idea was pus was
  - **He called pus "nuclein"**
  - He found presence of **nitrogen** and **phosphorus**
  - *Nuclein is what is seen as nucleic acid*
- **Archibald Garrod, 1902**
  - English Physician
  - He linked inheritance of inborn metabolism errors with the lack of certain enzymes
    - ex: "You aren't able to grow tall because the tall enzyme isn't in your body...but your dad also has the same issue..."
- **Fredrick Griffith, 1928**
  - English Microbiologist
  - Worked with pneumonia bacteria 
    - Type S -> bacteria is enclosed in polysaccharide (protein) capsule
    - Type R -> No protein capsule
  - Termed the conversion of one bacterial type into another as transformation
    - Type S could become Type R and vice verse given certain conditions
  - **Discovery of Bacterial Transformation:**
    - Type R Bacterial does not kill mice -> non-virulent
    - Type S Bacteria does kill mice -> virulent
    - Type S (treated with heat) does **not** kill mice
    - Type R + Heated Type S **does** kill mice -> Live Type S found in dead mice
    - **Type S Bacteria transferred killing trait to Type R**
- **Avery, MacLeod, McCarty, 1944**
  - American Physicians enter the race
  - Experimented with Protease (protein killing) and DNase (Nuclein killing)
  - **Experiment #2**
    - Heat-Treated Smooth Virulent + Protease + Rough Nonvirulent -> mice dead
    - Heat-Treated Smooth Virulent + DNase + Rough Nonvirulent -> mice alive
    - This experiment revealed that the protein shell around Type S was **not** the element that gave the Type S the killing trait. Instead it was the **Nuclein** inside that brought about transformation.
  - DNA is the **transforming principle**
    - can convert from Type R to Type S
- **Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase, 1953**
  - American Microbiologist
  - both scientists contributed equally
  - worked on E. Coli bacteria (that was infected with a virus that consisted of a protein head surrounding DNA)
  - Grew a batch of virus in a medium containing 35S and 32P
    - no one knew about the dangers of radiactive isotopes and most of these scientist died
    - but the radioactive molecules can be caught on camera because they kept exuding radiation
  - **Experiment #3**
    - virus protein coat was traced with radioactive molecules
    - DNA inside was also traced (nitrogen, phosphorus, etc)
    - the transferring element on a virus is not the protein coat around the virus, but the DNA on the inside
- **Phoebus Levine**
  - Russian-American Biochemist
  - identified the 5-carbon sugars ribose (sugar with oxygen atom) in 1909 and deoxyribose (sugar without oxygen atom) in 1929
    - RNA has Ribose
    - DNA has Deoxyribose
  - discovered that the three parts of a necleotide are found in equal proportions:
    - sugar
    - phosphate
- **Erwin Chargaff, 1951**
  - found ATGC
  - found relationships between these 
    - A -> T and G -> C
- **Rosalind Frnklin and Maurice Wilkins, 1952**
  - English scientists
  - Franklin used X-Ray Diffraction
    - radioactivity
    - incorporate radioactivity and observe the emission of radiation on x-ray films after treating the DNA in different ways
  - Discovered that DNA is in two forms:
    - Form A -> dry in crystalline
    - Form B -> wet and cellular
  - Photo 51
    - looking at a double helix from the top
    - Franklin came up with the hypothesis that DNA was made up of two different strands that wind around each other
- **James Watson and Francis Crick**
  - did **not** perform any experiments
  - they listened to Franklin and Wilkins and in their minds, they deduced the structure of DNA
  - they were highly inspired by Wilkins and Franklin, but Wilkins and Franklin get no credit
    - they included Wilkins, but Franklin died before that unfortunately
