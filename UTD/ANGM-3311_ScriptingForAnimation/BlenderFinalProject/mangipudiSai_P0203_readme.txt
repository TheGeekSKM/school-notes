My project is the Sai Tools addon. 

Currently the addon only contains the Custom Sky Tool that I have created for this project, 
but I intend to keep adding tools and resources to this addon as time goes on.

The Custom Sky Tool has three main sections that are meant to be used during three distinct phases of development.

The First Section is the Random Sky section. By clicking the button in this section, the sky will randomly change and morph without
adhering to any pre-existing rules or conditions. The goal of this section is to allow the lighting artist to scroll through many variations
of the sky to see if any interesting lighting conditions and patterns arise.

The Second Section is the Pre-Existing Skies section. In this section, the user can pick from a list of pre-existing sky templates that I
have created and preset. The goal of this section is to let the lighting artist start from a base lighting scenario that they enjoy and
then iterate from that starting point. This is meant to be a better starting point for lighting artist who have a specific setting to adhere
to.

The Third Section is the Sky Details section. In this section, there are an abundant set of values that control various elements in the sky.
These values are constantly being updated as the buttons in the tool are pressed. These values can be changed and updated to allow the 
lighting artist a much finer level of control than the previous sections. The goal of the third section is to be an addon to the previous
sections. A lighting artist can start with a random sky and then fine tune the details more when they have found a sky they liked.
