# Programming

## What is Programming
- identifying and solving a problem
  - cannot create something if you don't know what the problem is
  - how can I solve this manually
- write instructions for the computer so that the computer can solve similar problems for you repeatedly

## Solving Problems
- a creative way of putting things together to accomplish a goal

## Code
- formal language that gives computers instructions
  - formal language example: Math, Music
  - universal definition of language

## Terminal
- command line, shell, bash, etc.
- Python is tied to the terminal and the command line
- [git-bash](https://git-scm.com/)

### Prompt
- Ex: **PC C:/Users/userName>**

### Interactive Python Repl
- interative one line python

### FileSystem
- literally files -> you already know most of this stuff

### Commands
- **pwd** -> print working directory
- **ls** -> list
- **cd** -> change directory
  - **cd ..** -> move up one directory
- **mkdir** -> make a directory in your current pwd, ACCEPTS AND ARGUMENT
