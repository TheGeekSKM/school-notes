### Department Meeting Notes
- Simplicity in Code
  - Don't worry about Efficiency or Optimization just yet
  - We will get to that
  - For now, find the simplest solution you can

- COMMUNICATION
  - If you have any doubts please send many many questions to the designers
  - Even if you disagree, follow what they say

- Programming Asset List
  - Ask your group's PM if they can potentially help make a Programming Asset List for you
  - This will contain all the features/mechanics that the Designers want from you
  - Along with the deadlines for the mechanics
  - If you need any help with this, lemme know since I probably will have access to every teams Programming Asset List

- Important Stuff That Needs To Be Mentioned
  - Issues with schedule -> talk to PMs
  - Issues with communication/other people -> talk to me
  - Issues with tech -> talk to me or any of the other programmers
  - Please familiarize yourself with Gitkraken and Github as much as you can since if things go wrong, people will come to us for help
  - Fortunately or Unfortunately, whatever Design says goes.
    - even if you disagree with a mechanic, feel free to offer feedback, but at the end of the day, you still need to implement what they tell you to
  - Please DO NOT spend most of your week on this project
    - One: when things change and mechanics are removed/edited, this is gonna suck
    - Two: too much time => over-engineering problems => more problems
    - If you find yourself needing to spend way too much time to meet deadlines, let your PM or me know and we'll help in any way we can.
  - Thankfully, Ian, the lead designer is focused on simplicity more than fancy mechanics.

### File Management
- how do you guys wanna do File Management to make things more organized
- should file management be determined by teams or as a departmemt?
