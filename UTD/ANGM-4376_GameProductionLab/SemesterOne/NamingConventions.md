# Naming Conventions

### Github Branch Naming Conventions
- (Department Name)/(Team Name)/(Feature Name)
- Example: programming/gm1/character-controller

### Asset Naming Conventions
- Follow the Naming Conventions in the [Unreal Engine Docs](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProductionPipelines/AssetNaming/)

### Folder Naming Conventions
- Make your folders inside your Team's Folders' Department Folder
  - EX: My Prototype Folder will be inside "Content/Core/Programming/**Prototype**"
- Generally, if you are making a folder for your feature, name the folder based on the Feature
  - EX: GameMode 1's Character Controller Folder should be located at and called "Content/GameMode1/Programming/**CharacterController**"
- Although, if you want to further specify the name, feel free
- WARNING: Do not make the name too long!
