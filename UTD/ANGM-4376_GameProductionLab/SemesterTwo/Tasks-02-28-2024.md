# Tasks for EVERYBODYYYYY @Programmer 
*Note: I know that there are so many tasks. But please do not feel overwhelmed. Not all of these tasks are due by 03/04/2024 at 11:59pm. I have identified certain tasks as **[High Priority]** that are due by the aforementioned date. Even then, if some of the tasks are not finished, that's completely ok.*

## GameMode 1: @bobystar and @skinnygoblin 
1. Sound Effect Events *(Some of these might already be done, but it wouldn't hurt to check :))*
   1. **[High Priority]** PlayerRocketBurstStarted
      1. *Event Fires when dash is pressed by any player* 
   2. **[High Priority]** PlayerRocketBurstImpact
      1. *Event Fires when any player collides with another object while dashing*
   3. PlayerRocketBurstRecharged
      1. *Event Fires when any player's dash stamina has recharged and they can dash again*
   4. **[High Priority]** PlayerDeath
      1. *Event Fires when a player has died and needs to respawn (I think this one already exists)*
   5. **[High Priority]** PlayerSpawn
      1. *Event Fires when player is respawned back in after dying (this one also exists too probably)*
   6. PlayerRunning (bool, transform)
      1. *This one is funky. I essentially want this event to fire when any player starts running and when any player stops running. You need to pass in a bool that represents whether the player is running or not and the player's transform*

      1. *Event Fires when a Normal Meteor Appears*
   8. **[High Priority]** HazardMeteorFalling
      1. *Event Fires when a Normal Meteor Falls*
   9.  HazardLargeMeteorAppears
      1. *Event Fires when a Large Meteor Appears*
   10. HazardLargeMeteorFalling
      1. *Event Fires when a Large Meteor Falls*
   11. **[High Priority]** HazardIceSpreading (bool)
       1.  *This one is also a bit funky. I want this event to fire when the Ice Hazard starts spreading and also fire when the Ice Hazard stops expanding. During expansion, it should return true and after expansion, it should return false*
   12. **[High Priority]** HazardBumpersRaise
       1.  *Event Fires when Bumpers Raise*
   13. HazardBumpersLower
       1.  *Event Fires when Bumpers Fall*
   14. **[High Priority]** HazardBumpersCollision (transform)
       1.  *This event fires whenever a player bumps into a hazard and it needs to return the transform of the collision*
   15. **[High Priority]** WallsDropped
       1.  *This event fires when a wall drops*

   20. **[High Priority]** UIGameStart
       1.  *Event fires when the game has started*

       1.  *Event fires when there are 10 seconds left in the game*

       1.  *Event fires when the game has ended*
   24. UIHazardSpawnAlert
       1.  *Event fires whenever a hazard is reached on the timer*
2.  VFX Events *(Most of the VFX events happen at the same time as the SFX Events so I'll just use those, but the following is the only one that's a bit different)*
    2.  **[High Priority]** CrownPreSpawn
3.  **[High Priority]** Crown needs to respawn at the center of the level
4.  Fix GM1 Player Colors to pull from the GameInstance. *(I'd talk to @veryhuman about this since he's much better at taming the Lobby Beast than I am)*
5.  **[High Priority]** Freeze GM1 Player movement until countdown ends
    1.  ***Important Note:** the players' rotation should still be enabled, just movement is disabled.*
6.  Crown Respawn Decal
    1.  for now, whoever is working on this task, just make a programmerArt decal that we can replace later.


## GameMode 2: @surilexa and @stardream09 
1. Sound Effects Events *(imma be honest, most of these are high priority...much tank)*:
   1. **[High Priority]** OnPlayerCollision

   2. **[High Priority]** OnPlayerDashEngaged
      1. *This event fires when a player dashes*
   3. **[High Priority]** OnPlayerDashCollision
      1. *This event fires when a player who is dashing collides with any obstacles (including fast->slow collisions)*
   4. OnPlayerDualDashCollision
      1. *this event fires when a two dashing players collides (fast->fast collision)*
   5. **[High Priority]** OnPlayerGroundCollision
   6. *This event fires when a player hits the ground (I'd recommend giving the ground a tag if possible and checking for the tag during collision checks)*
   7. **[High Priority]** OnPlayerDeath
      1. *This event fires when a player falls off the map (this should already exist)*
   8. **[High Priority]** OnStarPreSpawn
      1. *This event fires right before a star spawns*
   9.  **[High Priority]** OnStarSpawn
       1.  *This event fires when a star spawns*
   10. **[High Priority]** OnLargeStarPreSpawn
       1.  *This event fires right before a large star spawns*
   11. **[High Priority]** OnLargeStarSpawn
       1.  *This event fires when a large star spawns*
   12. **[High Priority]** OnStarCollected

   14. **[High Priority]** OnStarStolen
       1.  *This event fires when a star is stolen (the main difference between this and the PlayerDashCollisions is that this event only fires if there is guarantee for a star to be stolen. So collisions with obstacles wouldn't fire this event, but they would fire the OnPlayerDashCollision event)*
