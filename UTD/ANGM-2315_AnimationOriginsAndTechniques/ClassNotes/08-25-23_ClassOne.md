- illusion of movement
- Even historians and academics cannot agree on one single definition of animation
- animation is constantly changing
- how does AI effect animation
- constantly revising and restructuring the definition of animation
- FAVORITE DEFINITION
  - Animation is not the art of drawings that move but the art of movements that are drawn." - Norman McLaren
- "Animation is a term that is used to describe a broad range of practices in which the illusion of motion is created through the incremental movement of forms, displayed sequentially as a motion picture" - Maureen Furniss
