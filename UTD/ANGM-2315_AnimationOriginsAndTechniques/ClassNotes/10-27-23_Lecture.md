#### Surogat

- simple background
- simple shapes, abstract
- movement synced with music in certain parts
- most of the sfx seem to be instruments
- First film outside of North America to win Oscar

  - both animations do that

- Fyodor Khitruk
  - knew many people in the USSR govt, a lot of his animations passed through because of his connections

  - Russia is recieving a lot of Jewish Immigrants
- Russia has a long complex history with the mistreatment of Jews
- When Cheburashka was produced, the common language was Yiddish instead of Russian

#### Man in Frame
- Really Cool Intro
- Monochromatic Color Scheme
- NVM, the images are multi colored
- The Man in Frame seems to be watching from his frame
- he seems to work as a Middleman of information, until he dethrones another frame
- Some Frames are bigger than other frames
- Man In Frame seems to keep climbing to the top
- The Y-Axis seems to denote power hierarchy
- Frame gets bigger as he gets more powerful
  
#### Door
- Stop Motion
- very detailed background
- Door doesn't seem to open
- People are trying to get in via other means
- Moving Background via turntable..?
- Frame inside of Frame
- Represents any problem/change

#### Note:
- I love the detail and the artistry that went into these animations and how they tell entirely different kind of stories with different comedic timing, pacing, storytelling, etc. It show how innately cultural these storytelling elements are

### Checloslovakia:
- Jiri Trnka
  - The Hand (1965)
  - Directed films but didn't necessarily animate
- Jan Svankmajer
  - Dimensions of Dialogue
    - uncomfy

#### Dimensions of Dialogue
- So much visual noise
- Chontrolled Chaos in every frame
- Models get more and more detailed every time they fight
- I liked that it is open to interpretation
  - I do wonder who the target audience is for Jan
  - Who does he make his films for
    - Himself? Certain People? The Public?
