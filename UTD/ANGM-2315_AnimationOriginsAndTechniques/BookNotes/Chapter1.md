### Chapter Outline
- Early Innovations in Simulating Movement
- The Printing Press and Comic Strips
- The Impact of Photography on Studies of Locomotion
- The Transition to Animated Cinema

### Global Storylines
- The development of mass-market production during the Industrial Revolution establishes the necessary technologies for animation production
- Magic-lanterns shows and optical illusion toys appear in Europe and delight the public with their illusions of movement
- the popularity of newspaper comic strips in the US provides a bases for animated series
- Eadweard Muybridge and Etienne-Jules Marey in turn carry out pioneering research in motion studies.

### Notes
- Animation describes broad range of practices in which the illusion of motion is created through the incremental movement of forms, displayed sequentially as a "motion picture".
  - Further divided into three subcategories
    - 2D Animation
    - Stop-Motion
    - 3D Animation

- Animation is diverse field, though
  - origins dating far back into history
  - difficult to define parameters

- Earliest examples
  - Animated Movement in Prehistoric Paintings
    - Lascaux Caves in France (15,000 BCE)
      - ancient images contain animals in sequences of slightly altered positions
  
- Factors that Influenced the Development of Animation
  1. Industrial
  2. Technological
  3. Scientific
  4. Cultural
  5. Aesthetic
  6. Personal

- This chapter focuses on the 19th Century before widespread availability of flexible filmstrips and related technology allowed for projection
- In Early Years
  - principles in animation were developed due to new scientific discoveries
  - discoveries in mechanics and entertainment
  - Magic-Lantern Shows, Optical Toys, Moving "Automata", Motion Studies of Movement, and Comic Strips
  - FIRST PUBLICLY PROJECTED ANIMATION
    - Emile Reynaud in 1892 in shows he called Pantomimes Lumineuses

- Wider Historical Context of First Animations
  - Result of Industrial Revolution
    - Technology for Animation appeared
  - Time of Great Social Change
    - British Nurse Florence Nightingale
    - German Political Theorist Karl Marx
    - American Harriet Tubman
    - Charles Darwin
    - Sigmund Freud

### Early Innovations in Simulating Movement

#### 1. Magic Lantern Shows
- Forerunner of Slide Projectors
- Popular Way to Purvey information and entertainment
- origins in 17th century
- akin to Powerpoint presentations
- series of hand-painted or photographic glass slides
- slides placed one by one onto wooden frame
- By mid 19th century, slides and related equipment became more varied
  - some of them incorporated animated movement for visual effects
- Chromatrope
  - consisted of two colorful, overlapping circular glass
  - when lit, the projection lamp spun in opposite directions with crank handle
  - viewers treated to dazzling light show
- Choreutoscope
  - held 6 images
  - when projected in rapid succession simulated movement
- First Reference to Projection Technology
  - 15th Century
  - Description by Italian Engineer, Giovanni Fontana ~ 1420
  - depicts man holding a lamp behind cutout of devil
  - casts larger form of it behind wall
- Tech behind Magic Lanterns
  - mid 17th Century
  - German Jesuit Priest Athanasius Kircher
    - Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae (The Great Art of Light and Shadow, 1646)
    - was revised in 1671 to depict complicated projection system
  - Dutch Mathematician Christiaan Huygens (1629 - 1695)
    - created first practical and useable model of Magic Lantern
  - In 18th Century, many other inventors joined in
    - Belgian Scientist Etienne Gaspard Robertson
      - phantasmagoria

#### 2. Motion Devices
- 19th century
- medical advancements
- Thaumatrope
  - disk containing pictures on both sides
  - spun to create effect of two images merging
  - "wonder turner"
  - British Doctor John Aytron Paris in 1824
- Phenakistoscope
  - "spindle viewer"
  - Belgian scientist Joseph Plateau in 1832
  - uses only one side of a large slotted disk
  - images lined up along edge, separated by slits
  - viewer in front of mirror
  - back of disk facing themselves
  - spinning disk => animated movement in cycle
- Zoetrope
  - "wheel of life"
  - series of images printed on strip of paper
  - placed inside spinning drum
  - viewer sees continuous loop
  - British Mathematician William Horner in 1834
  - originally called "daedalus" => wheel of devil
- Flipbook
  - British Printer John Linnett
    - called it "kineograph"
    - 1868
  - effect is linear rather than cyclical
  - common technique in drawn animation
#### 3. Automata
- late 18th century
- figures, created impression of life by carrying out automated sequence of actions
- advances in tech enabled development of advanced automata, run by gears and other internal parts
- sophisticated graphs have existed since the 16th century
- Clock Tower Mechanisms
- Hydraulics
- French Inventor Jacques de Vaucanson
  - created automation process for weaving looms
  - created flute player from 1738
  - created automated duck
    - paddled in water
    - shook head and neck
    - ate food
    - pooped pellets

### The Printing Press and Comic Strips
- press invented in Germany in 1440 by Johannes Gutenberg
- came to US in 1638
  - production of religious materials
- comics became very popular in US


### Conclusion
- variety of inventions and entertainments preceded development of animated film
- impact of Industrial Revolution
- impact of Modernization
- laid foundation for growth of motion pictures in 20th century
- by 18th century, magic lantern shows -> projection
- motion devices in 19th century -> thaumatrops and zoetropes
- development of automata -> science, tech, and art
- photography -> possible to isolate motion
- Emile Reynaud came at crucial moment
- invention of cinema and animated film
